# saehrimnir üêñ

This repo is a package containing two crates - a library named `saehrimnir` and binary named `bacon`.

```rust
extern crate saehrimnir;
use saehrimnir::prelude::*;

// Create an hierarchical deterministic derivation path.
let path = AccountPath::new(
	NetworkID::Mainnet, // Mainnet or Stokenet (testnet)
	0 // Account Index, 0 is first.
);

// 24 word BIP39 English mnemonic
let mnemonic: Mnemonic24Words = "bright club bacon dinner achieve pull grid save ramp cereal blush woman humble limb repeat video sudden possible story mask neutral prize goose mandate".parse().unwrap();

// Derive Babylon Radix account...
let account = Account::derive(
	&mnemonic, 
	"radix", // BIP39 passphrase (can be empty string)
	&path
);

// ... containing the Account Address
assert_eq!(account.address, "account_rdx12yy8n09a0w907vrjyj4hws2yptrm3rdjv84l9sr24e3w7pk7nuxst8");

// ... and its private key, public key, ....
assert_eq!(account.private_key.to_hex(), "cf52dbc7bb2663223e99fb31799281b813b939440a372d0aa92eb5f5b8516003");

## Etymology
[üá∏üá™ **S√§rimner** (üá¨üáß _S√¶hr√≠mnir_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A6hr%C3%ADmnir) is the eternal pig in **Asatro** (_Norse Mythology_)]([Norse_mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology)), that gets eaten every night by **Asarna** (_the gods_) and fallen heros brought to **Valhall** (_Valhalla_) and is brought back to life again to provide sustenance for the following day. A source of infinite pork. Read: an infinite source of sustenance - just like hierarchical deterministic account derivation!

# bacon ü•ì

**b**abylon **a**ccount **c**reati**on**
alt: **b**abylon **a**ccount **c**reation **o**n **n**etwork (accounts are virtual, so nothing is created "On Ledger", but rather we describe the fact that you select which network you wanna create the account for.)

`bacon` is a CLI tool using `saehrimnir`, allowing you to derive keys and account address from a Mnemonic, optional BIP39 passphrase, network id and an account index.

## pager

```sh
bacon pager
```

Which is the default, so you can just run:

```sh
bacon
```

Will start a pager, for security reasons, and this is **very much** the recommended way of running `bacon`.

## no-pager

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is not safe, your mnemonic and your derived keys WILL be present in your shells command history and output.
> ONLY Use this for mnemonics and accounts you really do not care about.

```sh
bacon no-pager \
--mnemonic  "zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo vote" \
--passphrase "secret" \
--network "mainnet" \
--start 1 \
--count 2
```

### Short

```sh
bacon no-pager -m  "zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo vote" -p "secret" -n "mainnet" -s 1 -c 2
```

### Help

```sh
bacon no-pager --help
```

## Etymology
Tasty derivative of `saehrimnir` üêñ, the infinite source of pork.
